# Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-UI
# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

## Overview
This project implements a secure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with authentication, authorization, and role management.

## Key Features
- Secure user registration and authentication
- JWT-based session management
- Role and permission-based access control
- Protected routes and resources
- Flexible role creation and management

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Authentication: JWT, bcrypt
- Database: Mongoose

## Core Components
1. **Authentication**
   - User registration
   - User login
   - Token-based authentication
   - Secure password hashing

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Permission management
   - Fine-grained access control

3. **Security Features**
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - Middleware for route protection
   - Role-based resource access

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=5000
   ```
4. Run the server
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to frontend directory
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Creating Roles and Permissions
```javascript
// Create a new role with specific permissions
const adminRole = await Role.create({
  name: 'Admin',
  permissions: [
    'create:users',
    'delete:users',
    'manage:roles'
  ]
});
```

### Protecting Routes
```typescript
// Example of a route with role-based access control
app.get(
  '/admin/dashboard', 
  authenticateUser,
  checkPermission(['manage:dashboard']),
  adminDashboardController
);
```

## Security Considerations
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWTs are signed and have expiration
- Middleware prevents unauthorized access
- Roles and permissions are dynamically manageable
